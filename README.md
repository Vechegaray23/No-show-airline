# No-show-airline
Implementation of a machine learning regression algorithm to predict likelihood of a high number of no show passengers.

Taking off with empty seats represents a huge opportunity cost for airlines, therefore having an algorithm capable to predict wether its necessary to overbook a flight or not, represents a huge added value to a company.

In the following repository, we analyze a dataset with information about several flights and then implement 3 ML algorithms.
